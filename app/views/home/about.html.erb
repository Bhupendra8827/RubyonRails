    When we are born, we get associated with our family by blood relation. However, there is a relation, which we choose ourselves.
    That relation is a friend.  Friends make our life beautiful.  The adventure of life becomes beautiful when good friends surround us. 
    We all belong to a family, where we have our parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins, etc. We get immense love, care, attention and
    guidance from our family. However, our entire life does not revolve around our family members only. We all have our own purpose in life.
    Some members of our family go to school, some go to college, and our parents go to work. We all have a life outside our family. 
    No journey of life seems interesting when traveled alone. We tend to make friends outside our family boundaries as that makes all
    life activities enjoyable.

<h3>Friends are Essential in Every Sphere of Life</h3>
<p>
    We connect very quickly with people with whom our interests match. Infants are playful by nature.
    They always look for the company with whom the can play and explore their curious nature.
    Hence, when they meet any other infant of their age they connect easily over their common interest of playing.
</p>

<p>
    In school, we make friends over our common interests. For example, students who like playing sports like cricket connect
    quickly and they become friends. Friends meet and discuss their common interests and nurture their interests together.
    Friends in school help each other in understanding the class activities, and homework. 
    They often exchange notes and reference materials among themselves.
</p>

<p>
    During our college life, we get independence in taking many decisions on our own. Also, many live in a hostel and are
    hence away from their family. Studying together, staying together, nurturing interest together,
    adjusting to conflicts with each other, helping each other all these makes the bond of friendship stronger.
</p>

<p>
    A friend highlights mistakes and guides us in many ways. They also motivate us to realize our full potential.
    Also, we can easily discuss and share such issues and thoughts with our friends which we cannot share with our parents.
</p>

<p>
    In our professional life also, friends also help us handle failure positively and multiply our joy of success.
    During midlife, we have huge responsibilities for family, job, etc. Discussing professional and personal stress with
    our friends makes us feel relaxed. They are our mental support and when we are in crisis, a good friend joins hand and
    helps in solving the problem.
</p>

<p>
    Because of the nuclear family structure of the current society in old age, people mostly stay alone.
     Friends hang out and travel together to explore various places and enjoy several hobbies together. 
     Friends thus eliminate boredom and loneliness from life.
     They add color to life. They become big support for any help needed.
